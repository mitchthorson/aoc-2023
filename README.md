# aoc-2023

This repository is my run at [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Who knows how far I'll make it. Giving it a go with Python this year. I really enjoyed dabbling with [Go last December](https://github.com/mitchthorson/aoc-2022), but this year I'm more interested in polishing up on something I'm more familiar with but don't get as many chances to practice.
